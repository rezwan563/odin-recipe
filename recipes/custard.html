        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fruit custard is one of those desserts that reminds me of childhood. Growing up, we would eat Carrot Halwa, Rice Kheer, Besan Ladoo or a fruit custard like this one for our sweet treat. Sometimes the fruit custard was served plain, and sometimes my Mom embellished it with fruit jelly. I can still see the labels from the Brown & Polson or the Crown brand custard powders and jars of Rex brand jelly in my mind’s eye! Isn’t it funny how food can take you back in time?</p>

        <p>A fruit custard is basically made by mixing fruits with custard sauce, which is why this delicious dessert is also known as fruit salad with custard. Depending on how you make fruit salad in your house, you can also feel free to add in things like toasted nuts, dried fruits or even vegetarian mini marshmallows </p>
