        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fruit custard is one of those desserts that reminds me of childhood. Growing up, we would eat Carrot Halwa, Rice Kheer, Besan Ladoo or a fruit custard like this one for our sweet treat. Sometimes the fruit custard was served plain, and sometimes my Mom embellished it with fruit jelly. I can still see the labels from the Brown & Polson or the Crown brand custard powders and jars of Rex brand jelly in my mind’s eye! Isn’t it funny how food can take you back in time?</p>

        <p>A fruit custard is basically made by mixing fruits with custard sauce, which is why this delicious dessert is also known as fruit salad with custard. Depending on how you make fruit salad in your house, you can also feel free to add in things like toasted nuts, dried fruits or even vegetarian mini marshmallows </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2.5 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons custard powder</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons whole milk warm or at room 
                temperature</li>
            <li>1.5 to 2 cups chopped mixed fruits – apples, mangoes, sapota, banana, pears, strawberries, pomegranate</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take milk in a thick bottomed pan or saucepan and keep it on the stove top. Bring the milk to a gentle heat or simmer</li>
            <li>Whilst the milk is getting heated, in a small bowl, take 3 tablespoon warm milk from the saucepan. Add 3 tbsp custard powder.
            </li>
            <li>You can opt to take the 3 tablespoons of warm milk from the milk which is getting heated up in the pan or warm 3 tablespoons milk separately in a microwave oven or on the stove top.</li>
            <li>With a whisk stir very well to make a smooth slurry or paste without any lumps</li>
            <li>When the milk has come to a gentle heat, add the sugar. Stir very well so that the sugar dissolves</li>
            <li>Keep the heat on a low and then add the custard paste at a time in small portions.</li>
            <li>As soon as you add one portion of the custard slurry or paste, stir quickly so that lumps are not formed. Finish off all the custard paste this way.</li>
            <li>Keep on stirring often while the custard is cooking, so that lumps are not formed. Cook for about 5 to 6 minutes on a low heat.</li>
            <li>The mixture will thicken slowly. For a thicker custard, cook for a few more minutes. Allow the custard to cool at room temperature. Also keep in mind, that as the custard cools, it will thicken more. You can also keep the custard in fridge to chill it before adding the fruits.</li>
            
        </ol>
