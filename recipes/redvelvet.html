        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Whether you are looking for a stunning red cake for Valentine’s Day or just need a showstopping cake for birthdays, holidays, or any other occasion, this red velvet cake recipe fits the bill. More than just a red-tinted vanilla cake, this cake is tangy and buttery, with a mild cocoa and sweet vanilla flavor.</p>

        <p>Red velvet cake is said to have originated during the Great Depression with the popularization of red food coloring and is a popular dessert in the Southern United States. It is such a unique cake that everyone will love. It’s definitely worth the effort to make from scratch as it’s far superior to any box mix. The cake’s dense and soft but still moist with a velvety crumb. It’s always a crowd-pleaser</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Baking soda</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Buttermilk</li>
            <li>Vinegar</li>
            <li>Red food coloring</li>
            <li>Creamcheese</li>
            <li>Powdared sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, sift the flour, salt, and baking soda together</li>
            <li>Cream the butter on medium speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add in sugar and mix on medium until light and fluffy. Add the eggs in one at a time, beating each until well combined</li>
            <li>Beat in the vanilla, then sift the cocoa powder into the butter mixture. Beat just until combined. Scrape down the bowl</li>
            <li>In a liquid measuring cup, combine the buttermilk, vinegar, and red food coloring. (The more you use, the brighter the color when baked.)

            </li>
            <li>With the mixer on low speed, add half of the flour mixture followed by half of the buttermilk mixture to the mixing bowl, beating just until combined. Repeat with the remaining flour and buttermilk. Stop and scrape down the bowl occasionally</li>
            <li>Divide the batter among three buttered 6-inch pans and bake for about 30 to 35 minutes or until the centers are springy to the touch</li>
            <li>To make the cream cheese frosting, beat the butter, cream cheese, vanilla, and salt together until smooth and fluffy. Gradually add the sifted powdered sugar to the mixer and continue mixing until incorporated. Set aside a cup. Place a cake layer on the cake stand and evenly spread ½ cup of frosting on top. Continue with the rest of the layers, then use the remaining frosting to coat the outside of the cake</li>
            <li>Place the cup of frosting into a piping bag with a decorative tip. Pipe a decorative border on top of the cake or as desired. Place the red velvet cake in the fridge and chill for about 1 hour or until the frosting is set.</li>
